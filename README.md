# AutoSamplerProject
The aim of this project is to create a program capable of recreating a piece of audio as as well as is possible given another piece of audio and pre-defined parameters to tune. In the course of the project, different measures for similarity will be implemented to see which one is the most true to, audible similarity. In addition, different approches auf synthesis will be tried, to see what types of results are possible. The code is written in MATLAB.
